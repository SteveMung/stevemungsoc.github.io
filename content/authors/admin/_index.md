## About Me

Hi! I'm Steve Liming Meng. I'm currently an undergraduate student at Fudan University, China, and a global visiting student at UNC-Chapel Hill. I am now an independent sociological researcher and a network analyst. My research interests include social network analysis, computational culture, and social stratification. 

I have been working on several research projects at both Fudan and UNC concerning opinion polarization, subjective class, work value, and cognition, using mainly social network analysis (belief network and its variants) methods and other quantitative/computational methods. I am now trying to explore the intersection between culture & cognition, social networks, and broader social identities and categories, and how LLMs may play a part in both these research processes and substantial cultural processes.
