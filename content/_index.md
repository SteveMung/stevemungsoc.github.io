      title: 'üìö My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        I'm an undergraduate researcher in sociology who works mainly on the intersection of social networks, culture, cognition, and social structure. I crave to become a computational sociologist and am working hard to achieve this. I expect to apply to a grad school in year 2026 and plan to start this new journey in year 2027. 
        
        I'm open to and interested in a wide range of advanced quantitative and computational methods. I'm also planning to develop the field (and skills, of course) of LLMs-as-agents in the near future (probably) to incorporate AI into computational sociology and social networks.
        
        If you're also interested, or if you like my works (which are all currently in progress and unpublished right now, so I don't think you would üòú), please feel free to reach out to collaborate üêï
