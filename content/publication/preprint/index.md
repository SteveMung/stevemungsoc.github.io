abstract: Drawing data from GSS 2016 work orientation module, I construct a work value similarity network. Using exponential family random graph models (ERGMs), I infer the stratification structure of work values and its socio-demographic causes. Further, with the distance matrix I develop a Relative Value Stance variable to measure one's relative position in this cultural/value spectrum in respect of their distance to their own ingrained class culture and their upward affinity. My preliminary findings is that the logic lower- and working-class people recognize and make use of work value is distinct from middle- and upper-class people, probably determined by some aspects of social structure.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Using the other-way projection of belief networks, I construct a work value similarity network, in which I can observe the stratification structure of work values and extract every node's relative position in the value spectrum. I try to explain the detailed mechanisms behind them.

This work is still in progress. It would not have been possible without the unwavering support and tireless help of **Professor Arne L. Kalleberg** at UNC, to whom I owe my deepest gratitude. I am also profoundly thankful to **Professor Jim Moody** at Duke, whose invaluable insights and critical suggestions greatly shaped and improved this work. The extended abstract of an early version of this work is accepted by **2025 ASA culture section roundtable**, but due to visa concerns (I'm back to China in May) I'm considering giving up this chance to discuss it with other scholars.
