abstract: Our study aims to construct unified metrics for both dimensions of polarization through network analysis to conduct a cross-national comparison of opinion polarization and further explore the influence of the political environment on opinion polarization. We use Belief Network Analysis method, dimensionality reduction techniques for network metrics, and OLS and Fixed-Effects models to achieve this.

We utilize **Belief Network** approaches to conduct a cross-national comparison of different opinion polarization patterns. Following DellaPosta (2020), we come up with the 2-dimensional measure of polarization and link that with political factors of different countries using OLS and two-way fixed-effect (TWFE) models.
